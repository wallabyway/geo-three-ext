# BIM Model Alignment Tool

## Overview
A visual alignment tool for positioning BIM models on terrain. The tool allows users to align a 3D model (like a building) to terrain by selecting corresponding points on both the model and the terrain, then smoothly animating the model into the correct position, rotation, and scale.

## Use Case
When a BIM model is loaded into the scene on top of terrain, it's typically not positioned correctly. This tool provides an intuitive way to align it by:
1. Selecting reference points on the model
2. Selecting corresponding points on the terrain
3. Automatically calculating and applying the correct transformation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Single Point Alignment (Translation Only) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Goal**: Move the model to align one point

**Status**: Complete - Ready for testing

**Workflow**:
1. User activates the alignment tool
2. User clicks on a corner/point on the 3D BIM model (e.g., building corner)
3. User clicks on the corresponding point on the terrain
4. Tool draws a visual line between the two points
5. Tool calculates the translation needed to move model point to terrain point
6. Smooth ease-in-out animation moves the model into place

**Visual Feedback**:
- Line drawn between source and target points
- Line updates dynamically as user moves mouse (before confirming second point)
- Line color indicates state (picking, valid, animating)

### Phase 2: Two Point Alignment (Translation + Rotation + Scale) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Goal**: Fully align the model using two reference points

**Status**: Complete - Ready for testing

**Workflow**:
1. After Phase 1 is complete (or as part of extended workflow):
2. User selects a second point on the building wall
3. User selects the corresponding second point on the terrain
4. Tool draws a second line between these points
5. Tool calculates full TRS (Translation, Rotation, Scale) transformation:
   - **Translation**: Moves first point to match
   - **Rotation**: Rotates model so the line between points aligns
   - **Scale**: Optional - scales model so distances match (may not always be desired)
6. Smooth ease-in-out animation applies the full transformation

**Mathematical Approach**:
- Calculate vector from point 1 to point 2 on the model
- Calculate vector from point 1 to point 2 on the terrain
- Compute rotation needed to align these vectors
- Compute scale factor (ratio of vector lengths) if scaling is enabled
- Apply transformation in correct order: Scale → Rotate → Translate

## Technical Implementation Details

### Coordinate Systems
- **Terrain**: The map object positioned at `map.position.set(14900, -27300, -85)` in geo-three.ext.js
- **BIM Model**: Loaded separately with its own transform
- **Approach**: Reposition the BIM model (not the terrain) using placement transform

### Model Transformation
Based on `blog-adam-placement.html` example:
```javascript
// Get current placement transform
let tr = model.getPlacementTransform();

// Modify transform matrix elements (4x4 matrix in column-major order)
// elements[12], [13], [14] are translation (x, y, z)
tr.elements[12] = newX;
tr.elements[13] = newY;
tr.elements[14] = newZ;

// Apply transform
model.setPlacementTransform(tr);
viewer.impl.invalidate(true, true, true);
```

### Animation Strategy
- Use requestAnimationFrame or GSAP/tween library for smooth animations
- Ease-in-out timing function (cubic or quartic easing)
- Duration: ~1-2 seconds for good UX
- Interpolate matrix values during animation
- Continuously call `viewer.impl.invalidate()` during animation

### Point Selection
- Use raycaster for picking points:
  - On BIM model: Use `viewer.impl.hitTest()` with model filter
  - On terrain: Use raycaster against map object (similar to existing double-click implementation)
- Store selected points in world coordinates

### Visual Line Drawing
- Use THREE.Line or viewer.overlays to draw lines
- Update line geometry dynamically as user moves mouse
- Draw in overlay scene for consistent visibility
- Clean up lines after transformation is complete or tool is cancelled

## UI/UX Considerations

### Tool Activation
- Button in toolbar or keyboard shortcut
- Clear instructions/prompts for each step
- Cursor changes to indicate current mode

### User Feedback
- Status text showing current step: "Select first point on model", "Select point on terrain", etc.
- Visual highlighting of selected points
- Preview of transformation before applying (optional)
- Undo/reset functionality

### Tool States
1. **Inactive**: Tool not selected
2. **PickingModelPoint1**: Waiting for first model point
3. **PickingTerrainPoint1**: Waiting for first terrain point
4. **Animating1**: Animation in progress
5. **PickingModelPoint2**: Waiting for second model point (Phase 2)
6. **PickingTerrainPoint2**: Waiting for second terrain point (Phase 2)
7. **Animating2**: Final transformation animation in progress

### Controls
- **Left Click**: Select point
- **Escape**: Cancel tool / reset state
- **Enter**: Confirm and apply (if using preview mode)
- **Right Click**: Go back one step

### Phase 2 Technical Details
**Two-Point Alignment Algorithm**:
1. Calculate model vector: `v_model = modelPoint2 - modelPoint1`
2. Calculate terrain vector: `v_terrain = terrainPoint2 - terrainPoint1`
3. **Project both vectors to XY plane** (set z=0) for planar rotation only
4. Calculate rotation angle: `angle = atan2(v_terrain.y, v_terrain.x) - atan2(v_model.y, v_model.x)`
5. Create rotation quaternion **around Z-axis only**: `q = setFromAxisAngle(Z_AXIS, angle)`
6. Calculate scale factor: `s = |v_terrain| / |v_model|`
7. Apply transformation accounting for click point offset:
   - Calculate where modelPoint1 will be after rotation around model origin
   - Scale that offset by scale factor
   - Position model so rotated modelPoint1 ends up at terrainPoint1
   - Rotation: Z-axis only (no flipping!)
   - Scale: Apply scale factor to match distances
8. Smooth interpolation of position, rotation (slerp), and scale

**Key Improvements**:
- ✅ **Planar rotation only**: Building spins on ground, never flips upside down
- ✅ **Proper point alignment**: Accounts for model origin offset from clicked points
- ✅ **Accurate pivot**: Rotation happens such that clicked points align exactly

### Phase 3: UX Improvements ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Status**: Complete

**New Features**:
1. ✅ **Smooth Reset Animation** - Reset button now animates model back to identity transform
2. ✅ **Quick Move Tool** (Simple Alignment) - Single-line translation only for fast positioning

### Simple Alignment Tool (Quick Move)
A streamlined tool for rapid model positioning without rotation or scale:

**Features**:
- **Orange visual style** to differentiate from full alignment tool
- **2-step workflow**: Click model point → Click terrain point → Done!
- **Translation only** - No rotation, no scale, just moves the model
- **Faster animation** - 1.5 seconds instead of 2 seconds
- **Perfect for rough positioning** before using full alignment tool

**Workflow**:
1. Click Quick Move tool button (orange/move icon)
2. Click any point on the model
3. Click where you want that point to be on the terrain
4. Model smoothly moves into place

**Use Case**: Quickly move your model close to the correct location on terrain, then use the full alignment tool for precise rotation and scale adjustment.
